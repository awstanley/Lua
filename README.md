# Lua CMake (5.3) Repository

This is a trivial CMake file with Lua 5.3.2 source files.  The original README (now `README.old`), and all files are as they were when extracted from:

    https://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.3.2.tar.gz

## Licence

There is nothing special here; the CMake file is in the public domain (or CC0, or MIT, depending on your location and restrictions).  Use it as you will.

Lua itself is available under the standard Lua licence (which is retained in the source).
